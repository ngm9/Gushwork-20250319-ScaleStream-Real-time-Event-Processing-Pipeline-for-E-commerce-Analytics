# ScaleStream: Real-time Event Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview
ScaleStream is a scalable event processing pipeline designed to handle high-volume event data from an e-commerce platform. The system ingests, processes, and analyzes user interactions in real-time, providing valuable insights for business decisions.

## System Requirements
- Process at least 1,000 events per second
- Handle various event types (page views, add-to-cart, purchases, etc.)
- Store aggregated metrics for real-time reporting
- Scale horizontally to accommodate traffic spikes
- Provide fault tolerance and error recovery
- Monitor system performance

## Architecture Components
1. **Event Producer**: Simulates or captures real-time events
2. **Message Queue**: Buffers events for asynchronous processing
3. **Event Consumers**: Process events concurrently
4. **Data Storage**: Stores raw events and aggregated metrics
5. **API Layer**: Exposes metrics and data for dashboards
6. **Monitoring**: Tracks system health and performance

## Implementation Requirements
- Use Python 3.8+ for all components
- Leverage AWS services (SQS, RDS at minimum)
- Implement concurrent processing for high throughput
- Optimize database operations for scale
- Handle errors gracefully with retry mechanisms
- Include comprehensive logging
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write unit tests for critical components

## Getting Started
1. Create free tier AWS accounts for SQS and RDS services
2. Set up your Python environment
3. Implement the components following the starter code structure
4. Run load tests to verify performance

## Deliverables
- Complete source code for all components
- Documentation of architecture and design decisions
- Load testing results demonstrating scalability
- Recommendations for further scaling and optimization

## Evaluation Criteria
- System throughput and scalability
- Code quality and organization
- Error handling and resilience
- Database optimization techniques
- Monitoring implementation
- Documentation quality
